## This is a series of files made following a C++ SDL3 tutorial on graphics: https://solhsa.com/gp2/index.html
# This branch strictly follows the tutorials, alternative branch is for my own alternative, more efficient/ effective implementation on sprite creation with SDL.
Created with the intention of using skills learned in 2D game engine development.
